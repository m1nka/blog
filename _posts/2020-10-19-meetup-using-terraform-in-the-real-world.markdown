On October 20th 2020 I had the chance to talk at Enterprise Java User Group Austria's online [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Enterprise-Java-User-Group-Austria/events/273258102/). There were two talks:

#### Taking Micronaut out for a spin - from [Andres Almiray](http://andresalmiray.com/)

  > Micronaut is a modern JVM framework for developing applications (web apps, micro services, CLI, etc) using Java, Groovy, or Kotlin. Micronaut is built from scratch using AoT (Ahead of Time) compilation that avoids any run time reflection. This allows Micronaut applications to start up really fast and consume very little memory. Pair it with GraalVMâ€™s Native Image and you get a winning combination for lean deployment and even faster startup. 

You can find Andres' slides [on Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/aalmiray/taking-micronaut-out-for-a-spin).

#### Using Terraform in the real-world: Lessons learned

  > While Terraform presents powerful mechanisms to automate cloud infrastructure it does have its limitations and pitfalls. This talk focuses on lessons learned when managing large production environments with Terraform. We talk about some Terraform basics, managing Terraform state, version control, collaboration, configuration drift, variables and integration with other DevOps tools such as Ansible.

 Please find the slides for the second talk below. I will publish the slides in form of an article soon ;)
