Hi 👋 I'm Max. You have stumbled across my blog where I write about cloud computing, tech, travel and more. I'm currently employed at Oracle as a Cloud Engineer. Previously, I've worked as a full stack developer and got my degree in Business Informatics from University of Vienna. Since I regularly work on cloud technologies, I've decided to share some of my learnings in this blog. I hope you find something entertaining or insightful ✌️
