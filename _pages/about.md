My name is Max and I currently work as a Cloud Engineer at Oracle. I've worked as a full stack developer for 5 years and got my degree in Business Informatics from University of Vienna. I'm especially passionate about all things related to travel and tech. Since I regularly work on cloud technologies (which are used by thousands of people around the world), I've decided to share some of my learnings in this blog. I hope you find something entertaining or insightful ✌️
